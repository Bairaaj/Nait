# This practice project use Bogus, a package that wraps up a c# implementation of Faker.

Ask about Bogus and Faker in class if you want, but the solution/project requires a Build to download and install the package before it can run.
Just do this once, and you will see a new packages directory, and everything should be ready for your solution.
