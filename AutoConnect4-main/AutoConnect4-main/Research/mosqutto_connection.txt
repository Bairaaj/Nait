in the local mosquittto file -> mosquito.config ->
listener 1883 0.0.0.0
allow_anonymous true

add that then force all mosquito server to stop

then go to the mosquitto file and .\mosquito.exe -> run this


then we are good





if not working then check for the default mqtt port -> netstat -a -n -o | Select-String "1883"

then if u get anything the last value of the line is PID we have to force close that -> Stop-Process -Id <PID> -Force 

then repeat the first process then its good
